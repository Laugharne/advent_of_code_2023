# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŽ„

**Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as **interview prep**, **company training**, **university coursework**, **practice problems**, a **speed contest**, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some **problem solving skills** will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to [Share on Twitter Mastodon] it with others, or directly via PayPal or Coinbase.
